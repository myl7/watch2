# /watch

You don't have a video input; this skill gives you one. A Python script gets a timestamped transcript (native captions first, then an ASR API), optionally downloads the video and extracts frames as JPEGs, and writes all of it to a markdown file. It prints only that file's path.

You then `Read` the report, write your notes into it, and answer the user. The transcript of an hour-long video runs tens of thousands of tokens, which is why it goes to a file rather than through stdout.

## Resolve `SKILL_DIR` (do this before any command)

Every `python3 ...` command below runs a bundled script under `SKILL_DIR/scripts/`. Set `SKILL_DIR` to the **absolute path of the directory containing THIS SKILL.md you just Read** — your harness told you that path in the Read result. The scripts are always a direct sibling of this file (`SKILL_DIR/scripts/watch.py`), in every install layout:

```
Read ~/.claude/plugins/cache/watch2/watch/<ver>/skills/watch/SKILL.md → SKILL_DIR=…/skills/watch
Read ~/.codex/skills/watch/SKILL.md                                          → SKILL_DIR=~/.codex/skills/watch
Read ~/.agents/skills/watch/SKILL.md                                         → SKILL_DIR=~/.agents/skills/watch
```

Substitute that literal path for `${SKILL_DIR}` in every command. This works on every harness (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, …) without relying on any harness-specific environment variable. Guard once at the start of a run:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the SKILL.md you Read>"
if [ ! -f "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/watch.py" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: scripts/watch.py not found under SKILL_DIR=$SKILL_DIR" >&2
  echo "Re-check the directory of the SKILL.md you Read and substitute it as SKILL_DIR." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

## Step 0 — Setup preflight (runs every `/watch` invocation, silent on success)

**Python interpreter:** every `python3 ...` command in this skill is for macOS/Linux. On **Windows**, substitute `python` — the `python3` command on Windows is the Microsoft Store stub and will not run the script.

On the first `/watch` invocation in a session, use structured preflight so you can detect first-run setup:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py" --json
```

Branch on two fields:

- **`can_proceed: true` and `first_run: false`** → setup is already done (the user may have deliberately skipped an ASR key — that's allowed). Proceed to Step 1 without comment.
- **`first_run: true`** → genuine first-time setup. Do these in order:
  1. If `missing_binaries` is non-empty, run the installer first (it auto-installs on macOS / prints commands elsewhere — see below) and confirm the binaries land. **Do not skip this and jump to preferences.**
  2. Run the installer once more if needed so it scaffolds `~/.config/watch/.env` (it only writes the template when the file is absent, so let it create the file *before* you write any values into it).
  3. Encourage an ASR API key and ask the watch-preference questions below, then write the selected values into `~/.config/watch/.env` and set `SETUP_COMPLETE=true`.
- **`can_proceed: false` and `first_run: false`** → setup was finished before but the environment regressed (e.g. `missing_binaries` after an OS change). Run the installer to remediate, then proceed. Don't re-ask preferences.

A missing ASR key is *encouraged to fix, not required*: on a genuine first run `status` will read `needs_key` even when binaries are present — that's your cue to encourage a key, not a blocker.

On follow-up `/watch` calls in the same session, use the silent check:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py" --check
```

This is a <100ms lookup. Exit 0 means /watch can run — this **includes a user who finished setup without an ASR key** (keyless is allowed). On exit 0 the script emits **nothing** — proceed to Step 1 without comment. **Do NOT announce "setup is complete" to the user** — they don't need a status message on every turn. The only acceptable user-visible output from Step 0 is when remediation is required.

On non-zero exit, follow the table:

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `2` | Missing binaries (`ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` / `yt-dlp`) | Run installer |
| `3` | Genuine first run with no ASR API key | Run installer to scaffold `.env`, then encourage a key (the user may decline — proceed with `--no-asr`) |
| `4` | Both missing | Run installer, then encourage a key |

Exit `3` only fires before the user has completed setup. Once `SETUP_COMPLETE=true` is written, a keyless install returns exit 0 and is never nagged again.

The installer is idempotent — safe to re-run:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py"
```

On macOS with Homebrew, it auto-installs `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`. On Linux/Windows, it prints the exact install commands for the user to run. It scaffolds `~/.config/watch/.env` with commented placeholders and default watch settings at `0600` perms.

**If an API key is still missing after install:** use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user which key they have. Recommend DeepInfra — it is the cheapest of the three and the only one that transcribes Chinese well. Then write it into `~/.config/watch/.env` as `DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=...`, `GROQ_API_KEY=...`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`. If they decline, proceed with `--no-asr` and tell them videos without native captions will come back with no transcript.

**First-run watch preference:** after the installer has scaffolded `~/.config/watch/.env`, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask one question:

- Default detail (one dial). Present these as `AskUserQuestion` options in this exact order — lightest to heaviest — and keep `(recommended)` on `balanced` even though it is not first (do **not** reorder to put the recommended option first):
  - `transcript` — no frames at all, transcript only (skips video download when captions exist).
  - `efficient` — fast keyframe pass (cap 50).
  - `balanced` — scene-aware frames (cap 100).
  - `token-burner` — scene-aware, uncapped (maximum fidelity; high token cost).

Write the answer directly into `~/.config/watch/.env` by setting the bare key on its own line — **no trailing inline comment** (a `# note` after the value can break parsing):

```bash
WATCH_DETAIL=transcript
```

Use the user's selected value. If they skip the question, keep the recommended default. Once dependencies, the API-key choice, and this preference are handled, write or update `SETUP_COMPLETE=true` in the same file. Do not ask this preference question again when `SETUP_COMPLETE=true`.

**Structured mode (optional):** `python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py" --json` emits `{status, can_proceed, first_run, setup_complete, missing_binaries, whisper_backend, has_api_key, config_file, watch_detail, platform}` (`whisper_backend` keeps its name for compatibility; it now holds an `asr.PROVIDERS` key such as `deepinfra`) where `status` is one of `ready | needs_install | needs_key | needs_install_and_key`. `status` describes the *ideal* state (a key is encouraged, so a keyless first run reads `needs_key`); `can_proceed` is the operational gate (binaries present AND a key is set OR setup was already completed). Branch on `can_proceed`/`first_run` to decide whether to run; use `status` to decide what to encourage.

Within a single session, you can skip Step 0 on follow-up `/watch` calls — once `--check` returned 0, nothing about the environment changes between turns.

## When to use

- User pastes a video URL (YouTube, Vimeo, X, TikTok, Twitch clip, most yt-dlp-supported sites) and asks about it.
- User points at a local video file (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, etc.) and asks about it.
- User types `/watch <url-or-path> [question]`.

## Recommended limits

- **Best accuracy: videos under 10 minutes.** Frame coverage scales inversely with duration.
- **Universal rate cap: 2 fps.** The script never samples faster than 2 fps, even when a budget or `--fps` would imply more.
- **The frame ceiling is set by the detail mode** (`WATCH_DETAIL` in `~/.config/watch/.env`, or `--detail`), not a single global cap:
  - `transcript` → no frames
  - `efficient` → up to **50** (keyframes)
  - `balanced` → up to **100** (scene-aware)
  - `token-burner` → **uncapped** (scene-aware; a soft warning prints past 250 frames)
  - `--max-frames N` overrides whichever cap the mode would otherwise use.
- **Full-video frame budget by duration.** Token cost grows with frame count, so the script targets a budget by duration. This budget sets the fps and the uniform-sampling fallback; scene-aware selection can fill up to the detail cap above, whichever is lower:
  - ≤30s → ~12-30 frames
  - 30s-1min → ~40 frames
  - 1-3min → ~60 frames
  - 3-10min → ~80 frames
  - \>10min → up to the detail cap, sparsely spaced (warning printed)
- If the user hands you a long video, consider asking whether they want a specific section before burning tokens on a sparse scan.

## How to invoke

**Step 1 — parse the user input.** Separate the video source (URL or path) from any question the user asked. Example: `/watch https://youtu.be/abc what language is this in?` → source = `https://youtu.be/abc`, question = `what language is this in?`.

**Step 2 — run the watch script.** Pass the source verbatim. Do not shell-escape it yourself beyond normal quoting:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/watch.py" "<source>"
```

Optional flags:
- `--detail transcript|efficient|balanced|token-burner` — fidelity/speed dial. `transcript` (**default**) = no frames, skips the video download when captions exist; `efficient` = fast keyframes (cap 50); `balanced` = scene-aware frames (cap 100); `token-burner` = scene-aware, uncapped. Frames are opt-in: reach for them when the question is about something *shown* rather than said.
- `--start T` / `--end T` — focus on a section. Accepts `SS`, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS`. When either is set, fps auto-scales denser (see "Focusing on a section" below).
- `--timestamps T1,T2,…` — grab a frame at each of these absolute timestamps (`SS`, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS`). Use this after reading the transcript to capture deictic moments the presenter flags ("look here", "as you can see", "notice this") that visual selection alone may miss. See "Transcript-cue frames" below.
- `--max-frames N` — override the preset cap for tighter token budget (e.g. `--max-frames 40`)
- `--resolution W` — change frame width in px (default 512; bump to 1024 only if the user needs to read on-screen text)
- `--fps F` — override auto-fps (clamped to 2 fps max)
- `--out-dir DIR` — keep working files somewhere specific (default: an auto-generated tmp dir)
- `--asr deepinfra|deepinfra-cheap|deepinfra-whisper|groq|openai` — force a transcription backend. Default: the `WATCH_TRANSCRIBER` config, else the first provider with a key (`deepinfra` → `groq` → `openai`). See Transcription below for when to override.
- `--ignore-captions` — ignore native captions and transcribe the audio with an ASR backend instead. Reach for this when captions came back but are **useless** (mostly `[Music]` / `foreign` / empty placeholders — songs, or non-English speech YouTube couldn't caption). Forces a download even at `transcript` detail so the audio is available. See "When native captions are useless" below.
- `--no-asr` — disable the transcription fallback entirely (no transcript if captions are missing)
- `--notes PATH` — write the report to a specific file instead of the default `~/.local/share/watch2/<date>-<title>.md`
- `--stdout` — print the report instead of writing it to a file. Only for debugging; it defeats the point of the file.
- `--no-dedup` — keep near-duplicate frames. By default a frame-delta pass drops frames that are visually near-identical to the previous kept one (held slides, static screen recordings, paused video) so the frame budget goes to distinct content; the report's **Frames** line notes how many were dropped. Pass this only if the user needs every sampled frame (e.g. judging subtle frame-to-frame motion).

### Focusing on a section (higher frame rate)

When the user asks about a specific moment — "what happens at the 2 minute mark?", "zoom into 0:45 to 1:00", "the first 10 seconds" — pass `--start` and/or `--end`. The script switches to focused-mode budgets, which are denser than full-video budgets (still capped at 2 fps, and still bounded by the detail-mode cap — the counts below assume the default `balanced` cap of 100; `efficient` tops out at 50):

- ≤5s → 2 fps (up to 10 frames)
- 5-15s → 2 fps (up to 30 frames)
- 15-30s → ~2 fps (up to 60 frames)
- 30-60s → ~1.3 fps (up to 80 frames)
- 60-180s → ~0.6 fps (100 frames, capped)

Focused mode is the right call for:
- Any moment/range the user names explicitly ("around 2:30", "the intro", "the last 30 seconds").
- Any video longer than ~10 minutes where the user's question is about a specific part — running focused on the relevant section is far more useful than a sparse scan of the whole thing.
- Re-runs after a full scan didn't have enough detail in some region.

Frames are extracted at the exact focus range. The transcript is filtered to a slightly **wider** window — the focus range padded by a lead-in/lead-out margin (25% of the focus length, clamped to 10-30s on each side) — so Claude sees the sentence that set up the moment and the one that follows it. The report's transcript header prints both the widened window and the underlying focus range. Frame timestamps are absolute (real video timeline, not offset-from-start).

Examples:
```bash
# Last 10 seconds of a 1 minute video
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/watch.py" video.mp4 --start 50 --end 60

# Zoom into 2:15 → 2:45 at 2 fps (60 frames)
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/watch.py" "$URL" --start 2:15 --end 2:45 --fps 2

# From 1h12m to the end of the video
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/watch.py" "$URL" --start 1:12:00
```

**Step 3 — Read the report.** The script prints two lines: the report path and a one-line summary. `Read` that file. It holds the metadata, a `## Notes` placeholder, the frame paths, and the full timestamped transcript.

For a long video the transcript alone can run tens of thousands of tokens. If the report is large and the user asked a narrow question, `Grep` the file for the relevant terms and `Read` only those line ranges instead of the whole thing.

**Step 4 — Read every frame path the report lists**, if there are any (there are none at the default `transcript` detail). The Read tool renders JPEGs directly as images for you. Read all frames in a single message (parallel tool calls) so you see them together. The frames are in chronological order with a `t=MM:SS` timestamp so you can align them to the transcript.

**Step 5 — write your notes into the report, then answer.** You now have two streams of evidence:
- **Frames** — what's on screen at each timestamp
- **Transcript** — what's said at each timestamp. The report's header shows the source (`captions` = yt-dlp pulled native subs; `asr (deepinfra)` and friends = transcribed by API).

**Before you answer, sanity-check the transcript when it came `via captions`.** Native captions are preferred because they're free, but "present" does not mean "usable" — yt-dlp will return a caption track that carries almost no information (a song that is all `[Music]`, non-English speech YouTube marked as `foreign`, or a near-empty track). The script cannot tell a rich transcript from a junk one — that judgment is yours. If the caption transcript is dominated by `[Music]`, `foreign`, empty lines, or filler for a video that clearly has real speech or lyrics, **do not answer from it** — re-run with `--ignore-captions` to transcribe the audio instead (see "When native captions are useless" under Transcription). This does not apply to ASR transcripts (`asr …`), which already came from the audio.

Write the notes into the report file: `Edit` it, replacing the line `_Not written yet._` under `## Notes`. Keep the notes and the transcript they came from in one file so the user can check any claim against the source. Then give the user the same notes in chat, along with the report's path.

Write the notes as:
- One paragraph saying what the video is and what it covers.
- The substance, grouped by topic, each point opening with its timestamp as a link back to the source. For a YouTube URL that is `[12:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ID&t=754)`; for Bilibili, `?t=754`. For a local file, plain `[12:34]` with no link.
- Anything the speaker asserts that you would not repeat without a caveat.

Do not paste the full transcript into chat. Quote only the lines that carry the point. Offer the raw transcript only if the user asks.

If the user asked a specific question rather than asking for notes, answer it directly with timestamps and skip the note-writing.

**Step 6 — clean up.** The script prints a working directory at the end. If the user isn't going to ask follow-ups about this video, delete it with `rm -rf <dir>`. If they might, leave it in place. The report in `~/.local/share/watch2/` is the durable artifact and stays.

## Detail and frames

Default behavior comes from `~/.config/watch/.env`:

- `WATCH_DETAIL=transcript|efficient|balanced|token-burner` (default: `transcript`)

At `transcript` detail — the default — captions are enough to return a report without downloading video. If captions are missing, the script downloads audio only and calls the ASR API. If no transcript can be produced, it reports the limitation clearly; re-run with `--detail balanced` for frames.

At `efficient` detail, the script downloads the video and extracts **keyframes only** (`ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey`) — a near-instant pass that lands frames on scene cuts. If a clip has fewer than 4 keyframes it falls back to uniform sampling.

At `balanced` / `token-burner` detail, the script extracts **scene-aware** frames: ffmpeg scene-change selection first, falling back to uniform sampling only when the video is effectively static. `balanced` caps at 100 frames; `token-burner` is uncapped. Frame report lines include both timestamp and selection reason. Extracted images are clamped to a maximum 1998px height for Claude Read compatibility.

## Transcript-cue frames

Visual frame selection (scene/keyframe) can miss the moments a presenter explicitly flags — "look here", "as you can see", "notice this", "watch what happens" — because pointing at a slide is often a *low* visual change. `--timestamps` lets you force a frame at those exact moments. **You** decide which moments matter, by reading the transcript:

1. Run once at `--detail transcript` (or any detail) to get the timestamped transcript.
2. Scan it for deictic cues — phrases where the speaker directs attention to something on screen. This is a judgment call (ignore rhetorical "look, the point is…"); that's why it's done by you, not a regex.
3. Re-run with `--timestamps 4:32,7:10,9:55` (absolute source times). For a URL, point the second run at the **downloaded local file** in the work dir so it doesn't re-download.

Behavior:
- **Additive by default.** Cue frames (`reason=transcript-cue`) are merged into whatever `--detail` already selected, in chronological order.
- **Pinned and counted first.** Cue frames are reserved against the frame cap before the detail engine runs, so they're never evicted by even-sampling.
- **Honors focus mode.** With `--start/--end`, any cue timestamp outside the window is dropped (reported in the summary). Coordinates are always absolute source time.
- **Cue-only frames.** `--detail transcript --timestamps …` skips scene/keyframe sampling and returns *only* the cue frames (it will download the video to do so, since frames need pixels).

## Transcription

The script gets a timestamped transcript in one of two ways:

1. **Native captions (free, preferred).** yt-dlp pulls manual or auto-generated subtitles from the source platform if available.
2. **API fallback.** If no captions came back (or the source is a local file), the script extracts audio and sends it to whichever transcription backend is configured:

| `--asr` | Model | USD/hour of audio | Timestamp grain | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deepinfra` | `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B` | 0.027 | ~27s | **Default.** Everything, Chinese especially. |
| `deepinfra-cheap` | `Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B` | 0.012 | ~27s | Long backlogs where cost matters more than proper nouns. |
| `deepinfra-whisper` | `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` | 0.012 | ~6s | Non-Chinese audio where you need finer timestamps. |
| `groq` | `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | 0.040 | ~2s | Finest timestamps. Non-Chinese only. |
| `openai` | `whisper-1` | 0.360 | ~5s | Last resort. |

All of them speak the same OpenAI `/audio/transcriptions` shape; the script extracts mono 16kHz mp3 (`ffmpeg -vn -ac 1 -ar 16000 -b:a 64k`, ~0.5 MB/min) and uploads it. Keys: deepinfra.com/dash/api_keys, console.groq.com/keys, platform.openai.com/api-keys.

**Why Qwen3-ASR is the default rather than Whisper.** On a mixed Chinese/English podcast, Whisper returned the entire transcript with no punctuation at all and turned "ChatGPT" into 差子就列, "运行脚本" into 允许脚本, and "语言方面" into 预言方面. Qwen3-ASR got all of those right and punctuated the output. It is also cheaper than Groq. The one thing Whisper does better is timestamp granularity: Qwen3-ASR reports fixed ~27-second slices, Whisper reports ~2-6 second spans. For jumping to a topic that is fine; for quoting an exact line it is not.

All credentials live in `~/.config/watch/.env`. Backend selection: `--asr` wins, else `WATCH_TRANSCRIBER` (`auto` or any provider name; `auto` walks `deepinfra` → `groq` → `openai` for the first key that is set). Use `--no-asr` to skip the fallback entirely.

### When native captions are useless → force ASR with `--ignore-captions`

The script prefers native captions because they're free, and by default the ASR backend only runs when **no** captions came back. But a caption track that exists can still be worthless:

- **Songs / music videos** — the track is mostly `[Music]` markers with no lyrics.
- **Non-English (or wrong-language) speech** — YouTube's English auto-captioner emits `foreign` as a placeholder for speech it won't transcribe, so a Japanese/Chinese video can come back as a page of `foreign [Music]`.
- **Near-empty tracks** — a handful of short, garbled, or repeated lines that don't match the video's length or content.

The script can't distinguish a rich transcript from a junk one, so it will hand you the captions and skip ASR. **You** make that call: read the transcript in the report (Step 4), and when it's dominated by `[Music]`, `foreign`, empty lines, or filler for a video that clearly has real speech or lyrics, re-run with `--ignore-captions` to skip the captions and transcribe the audio instead:

```bash
# Japanese song — captions were just [Music]/foreign; ASR handles the vocals
python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/watch.py" "$URL" --ignore-captions
```

- `--ignore-captions` forces a download even at `transcript` detail (which normally skips the download when captions exist) so the audio is available to the ASR backend.
- **Leave the backend alone unless you have a reason.** The default handles Chinese, English, and mixed audio. Override with `--asr groq` only when the user needs to quote exact lines and the 27-second slices are too coarse, and the audio is not Chinese.
- If you already downloaded the video on a prior run, point the re-run at the **local file** in the work dir so it doesn't re-download.
- Only worth it when there's actually speech or lyrics to recover. A silent screen recording gains nothing from ASR — use `--detail balanced` for frames instead.

## Failure modes and handling

- **Setup preflight failed** → run `python3 "${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py"` (auto-installs ffmpeg/yt-dlp via brew on macOS, scaffolds the `.env`). For API key, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` and write it to `~/.config/watch/.env`.
- **Download fails / yt-dlp returns nothing** → check `ytdlp_age_days` from the Step 0 `--json` output. A yt-dlp more than ~45 days old is the most likely cause; tell the user to run `pipx upgrade yt-dlp` (or `brew upgrade yt-dlp`). Do not reach for cookies or a user agent first. For Bilibili specifically, never set `WATCH_YTDLP_USER_AGENT` — a bare request works and a browser UA draws HTTP 412.
- **No transcript available** → captions missing AND (no ASR key OR the API failed). Script prints a hint pointing to setup. Tell the user; offer `--detail balanced` if frames would answer the question.
- **Long video warning printed** → acknowledge it in your answer. Offer to re-run focused on a specific section via `--start`/`--end` rather than a sparse full-video scan.
- **Download fails** → yt-dlp's error goes to stderr. If it's a login-required or region-locked video, tell the user plainly; do not keep retrying.
- **ASR request fails** → the error is printed to stderr (likely: invalid key or rate limit). Audio over the 24 MB upload cap is split into chunks and transcribed automatically, so length alone won't fail it — at 64 kbps that cap is a little under an hour per request. If some chunks fail the transcript is partial and the dropped chunks are noted on stderr. The report says "none available" only if every chunk fails. Retry with a different `--asr` provider.

## Token efficiency

Frames dominate, which is why they are off by default. Order of magnitude:
- 80 frames at 512px wide is roughly 50-80k image tokens depending on aspect ratio.
- The transcript is cheap in money (an hour of audio costs about $0.03) but not in context: an hour of speech is roughly 10-20k tokens. That is why the report goes to a file — `Grep` it when the question is narrow.
- Bumping `--resolution` to 1024 roughly quadruples the image tokens per frame. Only do it when necessary.

If you already watched a video this session and the user asks a follow-up, do **not** re-run the script — you already have the frames and transcript in context. Just answer from what you have.

## Security & Permissions

**What this skill does:**
- Runs `yt-dlp` locally to download the video and pull native captions when the source supports them (public data; the request goes directly to whatever host the URL points at)
- Runs `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` locally to extract a mono 16 kHz audio clip and, when frames are requested, JPEGs
- Sends the extracted audio clip to exactly one transcription endpoint, chosen by the resolved backend: `api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai/audio/transcriptions`, `api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`, or `api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- Writes the report to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/watch2/` (`~/.local/share/watch2/` by default; override with `WATCH_NOTES_DIR` or `--notes`)
- Writes the downloaded video, frames, audio, and an intermediate transcript to a working directory under the system temp dir (or `--out-dir` if specified) so Claude can `Read` them
- Reads / creates `~/.config/watch/.env` (mode `0600`) to store the transcription credentials and a `SETUP_COMPLETE` marker. As a fallback, also reads `.env` in the current working directory

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Does not upload the video itself to any API — only the extracted audio goes out, and only when native captions are missing AND the fallback is not disabled with `--no-asr`
- Does not post or modify anything, and only reads public data — except that if you set `WATCH_YTDLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER`/`WATCH_YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE` (needed for gated sites like Bilibili), yt-dlp will send those browser cookies to the video host. Setting `WATCH_YTDLP_REMOTE_COMPONENTS` (off by default) makes yt-dlp fetch+run a JS challenge solver component from its GitHub for YouTube URLs — an opt-in for when YouTube's anti-bot blocks a download
- Does not share credentials between providers: each key is sent only to its own provider's host
- Does not log, cache, or write credentials to stdout, stderr, or output files
- Does not persist anything outside the working directory and `~/.config/watch/.env` — clean up the working directory when you're done (Step 5)

**Bundled scripts:** `scripts/watch.py` (entry point), `scripts/download.py` (yt-dlp wrapper), `scripts/frames.py` (ffmpeg frame extraction), `scripts/transcribe.py` (caption parsing), `scripts/asr.py` (provider registry + chunking + upload), `scripts/config.py`, `scripts/setup.py` (preflight + installer)

Review scripts before first use to verify behavior.
